# URL-Encoder
URL encodes every line in a file skipping new lines so output is not all in one string. Useful for URL encoding payloads like i did in the example picture. For recursive encoding just cat the output.txt and copy it to input.txt 
and run the script again. Or make a function that iterates it for you.
