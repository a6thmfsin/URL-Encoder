# URL-Encoder
URL encodes every line in a file taking new lines in account so you dont end up with one long string in output file. Useful for URL encoding payloads like i did in the example picture. For recursive encoding just cat the output.txt file and copy it to the input.txt file and run the script again. Or make a function that iterates it for you.
